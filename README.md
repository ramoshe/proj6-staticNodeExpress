# FSJS Project 6 - Static Node.js and Express Site
 
My sixth project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program at Treehouse

## Extra Credit - Custom Styles
 - changed sidebar color
 - added Poppins as default font
 - added shadows to buttons

## Project Description:
In this project, you'll create a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects you've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where you'll have a chance to share contact info, practice your elevator pitch and talk a little about yourself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least your first five projects from this Techdegree.
